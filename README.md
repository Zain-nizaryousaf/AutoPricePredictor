# Car Price Prediction Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the factors affecting car prices in the American market using various regression algorithms. The insights gained from this analysis will assist the automobile company in making strategic decisions for entering the US market.


## Objectives
1. **Loading and Preprocessing**: Load the dataset and perform necessary preprocessing steps.
2. **Model Implementation**: Implement five regression algorithms:
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Tree Regressor
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - Gradient Boosting Regressor
   - Support Vector Regressor
3. **Model Evaluation**: Compare model performance based on R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
4. **Feature Importance Analysis**: Identify significant variables affecting car prices.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize the models to improve performance.
6. **Timely Submission**: Ensure all deliverables are met and submitted on time.
